            A Better Resume I&#39;ve taken pride in the fact that my resume didn&#39;t look like that of most engineers that I knew. Mine was cool. Mine was modern. Mine was sleek. But above all, I took pride in the fact that I thought it followed the tenants of good typographic design. In fact, I often used my resume as a jumping off point to talk about my love of the print medium, typographic design, and how I think about designing for the web, desktop, or mobile. It wasn&#39;t until a few weeks ago when I took a hard look at my old resume that I decided I wasn&#39;t designing for the user. I was designing for myself. This happens often...<br>

            Out of all the classes that I&#39;m taking right now in my penultimate (!!) semester at OSU, the most interesting one is probably Linguistics 3801: Codes and Code Breaking. Not only was I pretty enthralled with the 2014 Academy Award Winning Film The Imitation Game, I&#39;ve always been at least generally interested in codes and code breaking, mostly from a &quot;Hm, that&#39;s pretty cool, I woudn&#39;t have thought to do it that way&quot; sort of way. To assist with breaking some of the ciphers in the class and in an effort to finally start learning AngularJS, I decided that I would build a tool to help assist me with some of this code breaking. Currently, the name of the application...<br>

            Fact: I&#39;ve never done an honest to God, real life, 100% legit coding interview. At least, I don&#39;t think I have. I&#39;ve had the excellent (or perhaps not so excellent) ability to somehow not have to do a particularly hard technical interview... ever. So, with graduation coming in less than a year, I&#39;ve decided to brush up on some concepts that I may or may not have forgotten. Since teaching a subject is a great indicator that you yourself have learned the information, I&#39;ve decided to devote at least some of my blog posts to working through the great books that are Programming Interviews Exposed and Cracking the Coding Interview. Part I: Linked Lists Now, although I don&#39;t plan on...<br>

            Last summer I saw a Vintage Apple Extended Keyboard II and instantly fell in love with the keycaps that were on it. Weird, I know. Korean keyboard enthusiast Sprit posted some pictures on the popular Mechanical Keyboard forum Geekhack and I immediatly told myself I needed to build one for myself. That was essentially the start of what I would consider my now &quot;hardcore&quot; keyboard hobby. I had previously seen and heard of mechanical keyboards before -- in fact, the very first keyboard I had ever typed on was a Silicon Graphics AT101, with cream dampened ALPS switches. I could tell at the time that the keyboard felt much, much better than the alternative rubber dome keyboard that was included...<br>
